* Topology assumption:
* every client has bidirectional channel to every replica,
* every replica has bidirectional channel to every leader,
* and every leader has bidirectional channel to every acceptor.

* a pair of ip address and port# uniquely defines a role.
* below define all roles, for system with f <= 3. A role is assigned to a host as:

* Format:Role ID

* replicas
