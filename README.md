# Paxos implementation
Implementation of multi-paxos protocol. 

## What is this?

## How to demo this project?

#### How to build?

#### How to run?

## Understand Paxos protocol

####Just read these papers:

* The Part-Time Parliament, by Leslie Lamport
* Paxos Made Simple, by Leslie Lamport
* Paxos Made Live, by Tushar Chandra, Robert Griesemer and Joshua Redstone
* Paxos Made Moderately Complex, by ROBBERT VAN RENESSE and DENIZ ALTINBUKEN

#### Basic distributed computing concepts related to Paxos

* Time models -- synchronous, asynchronous, partial synchronous
* Failure models -- fail-stop, byzantine
* Definition of the consensus problem -- agreement, validity, termination
* Replia state machine(RSM)
* The FLP impossible result
* And other RSM protocols -- Zab, Viewstamp, Raft (Paxos, Viewstamp and Raft are based on similar ideas)

An excellent must-read book -- Distributed Algorithms, by Nancy A. Lynch
