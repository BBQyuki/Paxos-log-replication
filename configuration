//Topology assumption:
//every client has bidirectional channel to every replica,
//every replica has bidirectional channel to every leader,
//and every leader has bidirectional channel to every acceptor.

//a pair of ip address and port# uniquely defines a role.
//below define all roles, for system with f <= 3. A role is assigned to a host as:
//IP PORT ID
